# Opexis GPT

A GPT-powered pocket programmer.

An experimental platform that I've built, using GPT as a base, with the aim to facilitate code creation through interactive AI assistance.

Here's how it works:

* Start with a prompt: This is a simple description of what you want the code to do. The AI will then use this prompt to generate a set of clarifying questions to better understand the task.
* Answer the questions (optional): The AI will give you a set of possible answers for each question, and you have the option to respond in either a long or short format, or simply skip them. This feature is meant to add a layer of customization to the code generation process.
* Code generation: Once the initial phases are complete, the AI will generate code based on the information provided. The generated code will be highlighted using a syntax highlighter, and you can simply copy the code for your own use.
* Iterative refining: If the initial code doesn't fully meet your needs, you can write follow-up prompts to adjust the output accordingly.
